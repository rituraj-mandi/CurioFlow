# CurioFlow
CurioFlow is a curiosity-driven AI routine companion.
It helps you do tasks in a way that doesn’t feel boring, overwhelming, or robotic.

Instead of showing static schedules, CurioFlow focuses on how tasks are delivered—adapting to what actually motivates you.

🚀 What is CurioFlow?
Most productivity apps assume lack of discipline is the problem.
CurioFlow assumes boredom and decision fatigue are the real blockers.

CurioFlow:
Guides you on what to do and how to do it
Breaks tasks into small, doable actions
Adapts task style based on your feedback and behavior
Learns what keeps your curiosity alive
This makes it especially useful for novelty-seeking minds.

✨ Key Ideas
Curiosity-first, not schedule-first
Tasks adapt instead of staying static
Reduces overthinking and procrastination
Tasks can feel like challenges, experiments, or quick wins

🛠️ Current Status
CurioFlow is an early-stage personal project.
Right now, the focus is on:
Task breakdown logic
Curiosity-based task delivery
Learning from user feedback
The goal is to slowly evolve CurioFlow into a truly adaptive AI companion.

📌 Why CurioFlow?
Because not everyone works best with rigid routines.
Some minds need novelty, clarity, and momentum—not pressure.
CurioFlow is built for that.

🔮 Future Direction (Planned)
Adaptive task styles based on motivation patterns
AI-guided prompts instead of static reminders
Curiosity and focus profiling
Smarter task timing and delivery

📂 Tech Stack (Initial)
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
AI APIs (planned)
Simple local / backend storage (planned)

🧩 Philosophy
Productivity should adapt to humans — not the other way around.
